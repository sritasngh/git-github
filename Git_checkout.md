# Git checkout
 
It is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. 
This command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.

## Checking out branches

Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch. 
So checkout works to switch between versions of code already on the local system.
